I am a self-proclaimed **eternal-learner**. For that, after spending some years working with data as functional analyst specialized in banking industry, I’ve decided to go further and step into the Data Science field.

For that, in 2019, I enrolled an immersive Data Science program at the *Institut de Science des Données* of Bordeaux.

This blog is an opportunity to share with other people interested in this field what I’ve learnt (and I’m still learning) as well as some projects I worked on.
